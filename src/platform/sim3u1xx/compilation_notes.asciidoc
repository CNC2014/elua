Compilation Notes
=================

Silicon Labs HAL
----------------

In order to compile for this platform, it is currently necessary to copy the
"si32Hal" directory from within "C:\Silabs\32bit\si32-1.0\" to this directory
("sim3u1xx"). This is necessary until licensing is less restrictive on these
components.

General Build Requirements
--------------------------

In addition standard necessities for building eLua also apply:

* an arm-eabi toolchain

** the Precision32 IDE should work, and if installed in default locations, one
should be able to run "build_sim3u_dk.cmd" from the sim3u1xx directory to
perform a build and flash.

* lua with the requisite modules for driving the build system. (check the top
  of build_elua.lua for requirements)

** They're also included in luaforwindows:
http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/

* Additionally, it's recommended that you use git to check out the repository
  and have git in the path of wherever you'll be running the build system
  from.

Building
--------

If using a codered-based development environment like Precision32 on Windows,
see "build_sim3u_dk.cmd" for an example of running the build and flashing.


For other toolchains on other platforms, one can execute the following
command:

----
lua build_elua.lua board=SIM3U1XX-B-DK prog
----

Special Notes
-------------

The batch file mentioned above may need to have Windows/DOS line endings to execute correctly.  These should be set automatically if the checkout is done with the recommended autocrlf option:

----
git config --global core.autocrlf true
----
